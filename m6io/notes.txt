How to print the current path, the project path, the root path, etc. - find on SO

Reader/Write for characters
InputStream OutputStreams for binary

File f = new File("dir/file.txt");

	Doesn't create an actual file
	May create both dir or file

File is a class, platform independent
Path is an interface, has stuff

Avoid using old File, prefer Path
It's possible to convert between the two
